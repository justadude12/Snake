# Snake

A java version of the game snake, based on BroCode's tutorial on youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ

I made this to refresh my Java knowledge to prepare for an interview for a Java Dev Internship. The cost is almost identical to BroCode's version
apart from the fact that the game doesn't end when the snake goes into the wall.

At the moment I am happy with it, however I would like to go on to integrate a pop up menu, and the possibility to start the game again after losing,
as well as fixing the small bug, that lets you change direction so fast, that you run into yourself without moving.
